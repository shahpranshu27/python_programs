    "# # Write a program to create Tic Tac Toe game using the SimpleGUICS2Pygame module in Python.\n",
    "# # Game Instructions –\n",
    "# # 1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.\n",
    "# # 2. The player who places three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line wins the game.\n",
    "# # 3. The completed game should display the Tic Tac Toe board, allow players to make moves by clicking on the board, and correctly display the winner on the canvas when the game is over.\n",
    "# # 4. The game should also have a \"New Game\" button to reset the board and start a new game.\n",
    "# # 5. Ensure the characters ('X' and 'O') are centered correctly within each cell of the game board.\n",
    "# # Assessment Tasks –\n",
    "# # 1. Implement the draw_board function to display the Tic Tac Toe board, characters, and lines on the canvas.\n",
    "# # 2. Implement the mouseclick function to allow players to make moves when they click on an empty cell on the board.\n",
    "# # 3. Implement the check_winner function to check for a winning combination on the board after each move.\n",
    "# # 4. Display the winner's symbol (\"X\" or \"O\") on the canvas when the game is over.\n",
    "# # 5. Add functionality to the \"New Game\" button, so it resets the board and starts a new game when clicked.\n",
    "# # 6. Ensure the game board and characters are visually appealing and centered correctly.\n",
