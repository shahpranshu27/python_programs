    "# Write a Python Program using Memory Matching Game using the SimpleGUICS2Pygame library. The game involves flipping cards and matching pairs of cards with the same\n",
    "# number. Below are instructions and explanations for the code:\n",
    "#  (1) Initializing global variables:\n",
    "#  The new_game() function initializes several global variables used in the game. These variables are:\n",
    "#  deck: A list representing the deck of cards, where each card contains a number from 0 to 7 (duplicated to have a pair of each number).\n",
    "#  exposed: A list representing the state of each card. If exposed[i] is True, it means the card at index i is currently face-up, otherwise, it's face-down.\n",
    "#  state: An integer representing the game state. It can take three values: 0, 1, or 2.\n",
    "#  cIndex1 and cIndex2: Integer variables representing the indices of the two currently flipped cards.\n",
    "#  (2) Create new_game() function:\n",
    "#  This function is called to start a new game or reset the current game. It initializes the variables and shuffles the deck to randomize the card positions.\n",
    "#  (3) Event Handlers: mouseclick(pos): This event handler is called whenever the player clicks on a card. The pos parameter represents the position of the mouse click. The function first determines\n",
    "#  which card was clicked (by dividing the x-coordinate of the click position by 50), and then it applies game logic based on the current state (state).\n",
    "#  If the clicked card is face-down (not exposed), it behaves differently depending on the current state.\n",
    "#  State 0: Just started - Flip the first card, update the state to 1, and mark the card as exposed.\n",
    "#  State 1: One card flipped - Flip the second card, check for a match, update the state to 2.\n",
    "#  State 2: Two cards flipped - If the two cards do not match, flip them back (mark them as not exposed). Then, flip the new card, update the state to 1, and mark it as exposed.\n",
    "#  If the clicked card is already face-up (exposed), do nothing.\n",
    "#  (4) Creating the GUI:\n",
    "#  A frame is created with the title \"Memory Game\" and a size of 800x100 pixels.\n",
    "#  A \"Reset\" button is added to the frame.\n",
    "#  Event handlers are registered to handle mouse clicks (mouseclick) and drawing (draw) on the canvas.\n",
