    "# House Reveal Game Question:\n",
    "# You have been assigned the task of creating a House Reveal Game using the SimpleGUICS2Pygame library in Python. In this game, players can interactively reveal and hide different parts of a house by clicking on buttons. The house consists of three parts: a main body, a roof (triangle), and a circular window.\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# 1. The canvas size should be set to 400x400 pixels.\n",
    "# 2. The house is drawn on the canvas using geometric shapes. The main body of the\n",
    "# house is a rectangle with a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels. The roof is a\n",
    "# triangle that fits perfectly on top of the main body. The circular window has a radius of\n",
    "# 15 pixels.\n",
    "# 3. Define three boolean variables house_visible, roof_visible, and window_visible.\n",
    "# These variables control the visibility of different parts of the house. When a part is\n",
    "# visible, it will appear in the specified color when the corresponding button is clicked.\n",
    "# 4. Insert draw_house() function. This function handles the drawing of the house on the\n",
    "# canvas, including the main body, roof, and circular window.\n",
    "# 5. The program should involve use of three buttons labeled \"Reveal House (Red)\",\n",
    "# \"Reveal Roof (Yellow)\" and \"Reveal Window (Blue)\" to allow players to toggle the\n",
    "# visibility and color of the corresponding house part.\n",
    "# 6. When a button is clicked, the corresponding part of the house is revealed in the\n",
    "# chosen color and also clicking the same button again will hide the corresponding part.\n",
    "# 7. First, the main body should be revealed and only then the other parts should be\n",
